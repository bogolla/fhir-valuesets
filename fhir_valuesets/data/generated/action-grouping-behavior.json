In both cases, aspirin is the target referenced by the action, and the two actions represent different options for how aspirin might be ordered for the patient. Note that a SentenceGroup would almost always have an associated selection behavior of \"AtMostOne\", unless it's a required action, in which case, it would be \"ExactlyOne\"",
