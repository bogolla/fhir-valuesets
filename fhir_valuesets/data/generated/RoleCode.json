These role.codes may only be used with COVPTY to avoid overlapping concepts that would result from using them to specify the specializations of COVPTY, e.g., the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code family dependent because that relationship has overlapping concepts due to the role.code precoodination and is conveyed in FICO with the personal relationship role that has a PART role link to the covered party role.  For the same reasons, the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code HANDIC (handicapped dependent); the role.code DIFFABLE (differently abled) should be used instead.\r\n\n                        In summary, the coded concepts in the Abstract Value Set \"CoveredPartyRoleType\" can be \"post-coordinated\" with the \"RoleClassCoveredParty\" Abstract Value Set.  Decoupling these concepts is intended to support an expansive range of covered party concepts and their semantic comparability.",
